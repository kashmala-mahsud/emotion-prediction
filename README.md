# 🎭 Emotion Detection Web App

A real-time **Emotion Detection App** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Logistic Regression**. Just input a sentence, and the app will predict the underlying emotion — complete with emojis! 😄😢😠❤️😨😲

> 🔗 [Live Demo](https://lnkd.in/eN9jh6FU) — Try the app now!

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features  
- 🖼️ **Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a simple and modern user experience  
- 📊 **Multi-class Classification**: Detects 6 emotions — `joy`, `sadness`, `anger`, `love`, `fear`, `surprise`  
- 😊 **Emoji Feedback**: Emotion predictions visualized using relevant emojis

## 🧪 Demo

> Type any sentence like:  
> - `"I'm feeling fantastic today!"` → `joy 😊`  
> - `"I can't believe what just happened!"` → `surprise 😲`  
> - `"I'm so scared of this exam..."` → `fear 😨`
